    <h2>hacker [n.]</h2>
    <p class="aside">[originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]</p>
  </header>

  <p>A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.</p>
  <cite>&mdash; The Jargon File</cite>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p><strong>HackSoc</strong> is the University of York's Computer Science&mdash;or, more generally, computer enthusiast&mdash;society. We run mostly programming events: short series of lectures, seminars, competitions, projects, and the like. However, we're not just about the academic side of things, we also run socials! Boardgames and Cake and HackPub are our staple social activities, but we're also considering more possibilities, such as movie nights.</p>
<p>A list of activities can be found <a href="{{site.url}}activities.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The HackSoc committee consists of at least three members (chair, secretary, and treasurer), and the current members can be found <a href="{{site.url}}committee.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>So, how do I join?</h2>
<p>If any of this sounds interesting to you, great! We don't charge a membership fee, so feel free to just turn up to any events that catch your eye. If you'd like regular updates on what is happening in HackSoc, you can sign up to our mailing list by emailing <a href="mailto:hacksoc-list+subscribe@yusu.org">hacksoc-list+subscribe@yusu.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Get in touch with us!</h2>
<p>If you want to email us you can use <a href="mailto:hack@yusu.org">hack@yusu.org</a>. We usually hangout on IRC on <strong>#cs-york @ irc.freenode.net</strong>. Furthermore, you can, of course, contact a committee member directly if you want.</p>
