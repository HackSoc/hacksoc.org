  <h2>Boardgames and Cake</h2>
  <p>In one of the oldest and noblest traditions of HackSoc, we descend upon a room, play many boardgames, and eat much cake. Both boardgames and cake are brought along by members, so if you do enjoy the events, please consider bringing something along time.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox alternate">
  <h2>CoffeeScript</h2>
  <p>An unprecedented case of joviality and camaraderie has struck HackSoc, and we have responded with a weekly social over in the Glasshouse on Hes East. Come for lunch, a chat, and maybe a small game or two.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>Game Nights</h2>
  <p>It's reasonably safe to say we are a society with technology, and what's technology good for other than programming? Gaming! We'll hook up some consoles to projectors and fritter the night away.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox alternate">
  <h2>HackPub</h2>
  <p>Another tradition with a long and glorious history, the humble HackPub, in which we visit one of York's many fine pubs and converse late into the night about high culture, politics, and how old jet engines work over a pint (of something nonalcoholic, if you so desire).</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>HackTogether</h2>
  <p>A new addition to our roster, gathering in a computer lab together to work on our own projects individually or together, and order pizza. Being alone together can be a lot more fun than being alone by yourself.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox alternate">
  <h2>Movie Nights</h2>
  <p>Sometimes two films complement each other so perfectly that it becomes inconcievable to watch one without also watching the other. Or sometimes two films fall naturally into a coherent theme. We gather to appreciate such pairings a few times a term.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox">
  <h2>Reading Group</h2>
  <p>There are many great papers in computer science, and as it's such a young field most of them are easily accessible! Join us in reading and discussing some of these classics once every fortnight.</p>
</div>

<div class="infobox alternate">
  <h2>Talks</h2>
  <p>In which we sit in a room en masse and listen to someone who thinks they know what they're talking about. Usually we have industrial or academic speakers, but we occasionally have student talks too.</p>
</div>
