title: Talks
---

<p>
  HackSoc run talks from industry speakers, members and alumni throughout the academic year. These talks take place in the Pod (CSE/082&083) between 6:30 and 7:30 every Thursday, followed by a social, unless otherwise specified. Talks are 30 minutes long, followed by 15 minutes of questions. 
</p>
<p>
  Attending talks is a great way to get a diverse look at what a degree in computer science can be, whether it's more focused on industry or academia.

<h2>Upcoming talks</h2>
<br>
<h3><em>git --intro: A Primer on Version Control</em> by Josh Holland</h3>
<b>October 3rd (Autumn Week 1)</b>
<p> 
<u>Abstract:</u> Have you ever wanted to travel through time? Maybe you've wanted to see what your code looked like half an hour ago, *before* you broke the tests? Or have you ever needed to collaborate with multiple people on one codebase, even without an internet connection? Version control can help with these problems and more. 
</p>
<p>
This talk will cover the version-control system git, which has now been the most widely-used version control system amongst software developers for over five years. In no particular order, we'll cover why you might want to use git, how to get started, and (at least conceptually) how git actually works.
</p>

<h3><em>Behind the scenes of GOV.UK</em> by Micheal Walker</h3>
<b>October 10 (Autumn Week 2)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> GOV.UK is the single website for government to communicate with the public.  But how do over 3000 government publishers distribute information to over 60 million users?  Behind the scenes GOV.UK is a Ruby on Rails powered, microservice-using, highly-available,  distributed publishing system.  Come along to learn about just how big GOV.UK is, what it looks like behind the scenes, some neat public APIs you can use, and why GOV.UK developers talk about badgers, seals, and spaniels.
</p>

<em>At the request of the author, the this talk will not be recorded.</em>

<h3><em>The History of LEGO Video Games</em> by David Norman</h3>
<b>October 24th (Autumn Week 4)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> In the past 22 years, LEGO Video Games have become an important and rather unique genre in themselves. In this talk, we will look at how they have changed over time, the different styles and directions that have been attempted, and their cultural impact.
</p>
<br>
<h3><em>Can camputers compile complex code correctly?</em> by Matt Windsor</h3>
<b>November 7th (Autumn Week 6)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> Concurrent programs that make use of C11-style atomic actions are hard to reason about, with the formal statement of the behaviours such programs can exhibit -- the C11 memory model -- being notoriously unwieldy and permissive.  Worse, CPU architectures have their own memory models, so compilers must map from C to machine code in a way that preserves the original program's C11 guarantees inside the machine model.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, I explore the above situation, then discuss and demonstrate ACT, a toolbox for investigating whether C11 compilers such as gcc and clang actually do this mapping correctly.
</p>
<br>
<h3><em>Communicate! Pair Programming, sketchnotes and compassion</em> by Miki Mokrysz</h3>
<b>November 21st (Autumn Week 8)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> Communication can be a superpower for engineers, helping you collaborate and problem-solve without even trying. But ineffective communication undermines your work, and draining communication undermines your happiness.
</p>
<p>
This talk gives you ways to communicate technical topics without tiresome documents or formality. We'll look at the joys and perils of pair programming. We'll try out sketchnoting (drawing systems to explain them.) And we'll cover how to empathise with what other people need.
</p>
<br>
<h3><em>Where it all went wrong (or why programming sucks)</em> by Sam Hand</h3>
<b>December 5th (Autumn Week 10)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> The word “programmer” usually refers to a person who instructs a computer through the use of some textual formal language. 
To this person computation lives inside of a text file, represented purely as a list of instructions.
</p>
<p>
Contrast this to the idea of a “user”; someone who similarly instructs a computer to do their bidding. The user, though, achieves this by dynamically interacting with a varied selection of representations of the system - be they textual, visual, or even auditory. 
To a user computation takes on a much more rich meaning: it can be represented in a way suitable to the task at hand. However, the power available to them is fundamentally limited. They only have access to the features the programmer of the system chose to include.
</p>
<p>
This talk will explore the reasons behind this power difference, and maybe even suggest how to fix it, without sacrificing usability.

<h2>Giving a talk</h2>
<br>
<div class="noticebox">
  <b>Submissions for Autumn Term are now closed.</b> 
  <br>
  If you didn't submit an abstract and still want to, and are local to York, please contact us at hack@yusu.org and we'll see if we can schedule you in.
  <br>
  Submissions for Spring Term talks will open early in Autumn Term.
</div>
<p>
  If you're thinking about giving a talk, fill out the form above. If you give a talk, we will buy you a drink! You can assume that the audience will be familiar with computer science, but not necessarily well-versed in the subject of the talk. If you are not local to York, don't let that stop you from applying - we do have some funds to pay for expenses. 
</p>
<p>
  When submissions close, we will be in touch to confirm dates and expenses, as well as finalising your title and abstract. If we are able to schedule you in, we will be asking for any slides or handouts you may need at least a week before your talk.  
</p>
<p>
  On the day of the talk, we will ask you to show up at the Pod at 6pm to make sure that everything works.
</p>
<p>
  We will publicise our talks on our website and social media. We also intend to record all talks, but please discuss this with our committee if it is an issue.
</p>
<p>
  We look forward to seeing you!
</p>

<!-- Once we schedule talks, add a "this term's talks" section. -->
<!-- Once there have been talks, add a "previous talks" section with links to videos -->
