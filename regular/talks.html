<p>
  HackSoc run talks from industry speakers, members and alumni throughout the academic year. These talks take place in the Pod (CSE/082&083) between 7:00 and 8:00 certain Thursdays, followed by a social, unless otherwise specified. Talks are 30 minutes long, followed by 15 minutes of questions. 
</p>
<p>
  Attending talks is a great way to get a diverse look at what a degree in computer science can be, whether it's more focused on industry or academia.

<h2>Summer Term talks</h2>
<h3><em>How to move a radio station online, in five weeks or less</em> by Marks Polakovs</h3>
<b>June 4th (Summer Week 8)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> For reasons that don't need any elaboration, University Radio York, the UK's oldest legal independent student radio station, couldn't continue broadcasting from its studios for Summer Term this year. The team had a bit of a conundrum - do we shut down, as many others have done, or do we try and find a way to continue broadcasting? URY Computing Team chose the latter. Over the course of five weeks we built WebStudio, an online version of our playout and broadcasting system, letting presenters continue their shows from home with nothing but a laptop. In this talk I'll go over some of the design decisions behind WebStudio, how we implemented it, some of the challenges that we faced (including but not limited to: browser compatibility, Daylight Savings Time, and how to do maintenance during a lockdown with only two people on-site), as well as where we hope to see it in the future.

<h3><em>Ebooks are a Hard Problem</em> by C Wringe</h3>
<b>June 11th (Summer Week 9)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> Ebooks are simple, right? Just digitise the book. 
</p>
<p>
Wrong. Ebooks and the laws surrounding them tend to be ridiculous, due to the monopoly of publishing companies, the horror that is amazon, and practices that just don't translate very well to a digital world.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, I will go over why ebooks are cheap, why libraries have so few of them despite this, why I have an enduring grudge against Macmillan, and perhaps why the Internet Archive's National Emergency Library is misguided at best.
</p>
<br>
<h3><em>Abstraction and Complexity Management</em> by Jacob Allen</h3>
<b>June 18th (Summer Week 10)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> While most software systems start out simple, software systems can rapidly become complex, whether via increasing scope, misestimation, or many other causes. A common solution to many of the problems of complexity is the introduction of abstractions, that is, providing a more abstract interface to systems, or parts of systems, to simplify interactions with them. However, the introduction of abstractions adds choices and complexities of its own, and often exposes the assumptions and biases of those creating the abstractions.
</p>
<p>
In this talk I will give a high-level overview of what is meant by abstraction and software complexity in the context of abstraction, then talk about some of the problems and possible solutions to issues of abstraction and complexity, using practical examples across different scale projects and different application areas.
</p>
<br>
<h3><em>How alike are Computers and Minds?</em> by Rach Arnold</h3>
<b>June 25th (Summer Week 11)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> The purpose of this talk is to explore the notion that a mind is like a computer from both a scientist and a philosophical perceptive. I will focus on a number of comparisons between both how the mind and a computer works; however, I ultimately conclude that the mind is more complicated than we give it credit for. Despite the increase in technology and the wondrous development of the computing world, computers will never compare to the splendor that is the human mind. 
</p>

<h3><em>The Power of Cursed Code: A Tour of Ruby</em> by Aaron Christiansen</h3>
<b>July 2nd (Summer Week 12)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> In software engineering, plenty of time is spent talking about best practices and how to write beautiful, legible code. But what if your language has the tools, methods, and syntax to actively encourage throwing all that out of the window?
</p>
<p>
Meet Ruby, a dynamic language with the syntax of Perl and the semantics of Smalltalk. With a crossover like that, chaos is bound to ensue! In this talk, I'll discuss the core principles of Ruby, how its flexible design influences the way you build software, and the ridiculous code concoctions this enables. 
</p>
<br>
<h2>Past talks</h2>
<h3>Spring Term talks</h3>
<h4><em>Building Applications at Planet Scale - Developing for the Cloud</em> by Daniel Vaughan</h4>
<b>January 23rd (Spring Week 3)</b>
<p> 
<u>Abstract:</u> Cloud-Native Computing has drastically changed the speed and efficiency with which developers can deploy their applications. This talk will demonstrate how technologies like Docker & Kubernetes make use of abstraction, isolation & orchestration to improve the developer experience. Participants will learn about the issues of traditional application deployment, and go on a journey through containerisation, automation & scalability to learn how to build a modern application in the cloud. This presentation is interactive - get ready to stress-test a website! 
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>What's Python really doing?</em> by Aaron Christiansen</h4>
<b>January 30th (Spring Week 4)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> Python is one of the most well-known programming languages around. Its simplicity, elegant syntax, and huge range of libraries has propelled it to popularity. But what is actually happening when you run your Python code?
</p><p>
Underneath its minimalistic syntax, Python has a huge amount of complex heavily-optimised machinery. In this talk, I'll be taking you on a detailed tour of how Python's internals work, all the way from parsing your code through to executing it as bytecode.
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>AUTOSAR, in my CAR?!?! It’s more likely than you think.</em> by Jacob Allen</h4>
<b>February 6th (Spring Week 5)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> Cars are everywhere, and while we may think of them as the single, complete, deadly high-speed tin-cans they appear to be, underneath lies a much more complex system. A car is not a single unit, but a massively complex distributed real-time system with hundreds of computers, all connected together. How did it get this way? And how does it even function with so much complexity?
</p><p>
In this talk I will touch on the past, present and future of automotive software, with particular focus on the standard which dominates the automotive software industry today: AUTOSAR.
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>"The program counter is always off by 2" and other strange computer design choices.</em> by Daniel Bailey</h4>
<b>February 13th (Spring Week 6)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> When people design CPUs and software interfaces, they make decisions. Decisions that cut costs, simplify hardware, provide backwards compatibility, or shave a few cycles off a time consuming task. This talk will be a fun and [hopefully] insightful tour of some decisions that, in hindsight, were a little bit ... "funky".
Excitement includes:
<ul>
 <li> Why is the PC value always off by 2? </li>
 <li> What!? A reboot is triggered by deliberately causing three unrecoverable faults in a row? </li>
 <li> Setting this bit to 0 makes every instruction cause an unrecoverable fault </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>AI and Searle's Chinese Room</em> by Rach Arnold</h4>
<b>February 19th (Spring Week 7)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> Imagine there’s a sealed room where you can post questions, written in Chinese, into the room and receive the answers / responses back (also in Chinese). The natural assumption is that, the person in the sealed room who is responding to your questions, is able to understand what they are responding to (i.e. they can read and understand Chinese). However, in actual fact, inside the sealed room is a person with a basket full of Chinese symbols and a rule book; the rule book contains a series of instructions for the person inside the room. For example, if someone posts X symbol to the person, then he or she needs to post back Y symbol, even though the person in the room does not understand the symbols in question. This is Searle’s Chinese Room. This famous analogy brings into question the status of Artificial Intelligence and whether such a thing is possible. In my talk, I will be discussing the significance of Searle’s Chinese Room, how it links to AI, and possible responses to Searle’s conclusion. 
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>"git is not an SCM", and other git trivia</em> by Ash Holland</h4>
<b>February 27th (Spring Week 8)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> You might have heard of git, the "distributed version-control system". You might have used git yourself; you might even have come to the talk about git I gave last term. But did you know that, according to git's author, it's not a version-control system at all?
</p><p>
In this talk, I'll explain git's internals – how it actually works under the covers, talking about heads, refs, tree-ishes, @, and various other git concepts. We'll briefly cover git's origins, and the design decisions that made it stand out from other version-control systems, along with a smattering of "interesting" facts about git which you might not have known.
</p><p>
NB: this talk doesn't assume that you know anything about git, but I won't be explaining how to use it. You'll get more out of the talk if you already have some experience of working with git.
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>What Happens When You Don't Leave Academia</em> by Matt Windsor</h4>
<b>March 5th (Spring Week 9)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> At my previous talk, I was asked 'what even is a PhD?'  By convoluted way of answer, this talk tries to condense the last 5 or so years of my life into 30 minutes of discourse about: PhDs, why you should do one, why you shouldn't do one, life after the PhD, the good and bad sides of not self-yeeting out of academia after the undergraduate degree, and the constant never-ending quest for caffeination. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Autumn Term 2019</h3>
<h4><em>git --intro: A Primer on Version Control</em> by Ash Holland</h4>
<b>October 3rd (Autumn Week 1)</b>
<p> 
<u>Abstract:</u> Have you ever wanted to travel through time? Maybe you've wanted to see what your code looked like half an hour ago, *before* you broke the tests? Or have you ever needed to collaborate with multiple people on one codebase, even without an internet connection? Version control can help with these problems and more. 
</p>
<p>
This talk will cover the version-control system git, which has now been the most widely-used version control system amongst software developers for over five years. In no particular order, we'll cover why you might want to use git, how to get started, and (at least conceptually) how git actually works.
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>Behind the scenes of GOV.UK</em> by Michael Walker</h4>
<b>October 10 (Autumn Week 2) <em>in RCH/248+250 (The Lakehouse)</em></b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> GOV.UK is the single website for government to communicate with the public.  But how do over 3000 government publishers distribute information to over 60 million users?  Behind the scenes GOV.UK is a Ruby on Rails powered, microservice-using, highly-available,  distributed publishing system.  Come along to learn about just how big GOV.UK is, what it looks like behind the scenes, some neat public APIs you can use, and why GOV.UK developers talk about badgers, seals, and spaniels.
</p>
<p>
<em>At the request of the speaker, this talk will not be recorded.</em>
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>Break a Hacker's Mind - Web Application Vulnerabilities Exposed</em> by Morgan Stanley</h4>
<b>October 17 (Autumn Week 3) <em>in RCH/248+250 (The Lakehouse)</em></b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> Join us for a special interactive guest lecture on Cyber Security with the Security Architecture team at Morgan Stanley.<br>
Together we will work through a web application which is riddled with the common issues through which retail banking applications are compromised.<br>
This session will demonstrate how an attacker could exploit software vulnerabilities and explain remediation strategies.<br>
This talk has also been delivered at industry forums, universities and even the House of Lords!
</p>
<p>
<em>At the request of the speaker, this talk will not be recorded.</em>

<br>
<h4><em>The History of LEGO Video Games</em> by David Norman</h4>
<b>October 24th (Autumn Week 4)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> In the past 22 years, LEGO Video Games have become an important and rather unique genre in themselves. In this talk, we will look at how they have changed over time, the different styles and directions that have been attempted, and their cultural impact.
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>Can computers compile complex code correctly?</em> by Matt Windsor</h4>
<b>November 7th (Autumn Week 6)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> Concurrent programs that make use of C11-style atomic actions are hard to reason about, with the formal statement of the behaviours such programs can exhibit -- the C11 memory model -- being notoriously unwieldy and permissive.  Worse, CPU architectures have their own memory models, so compilers must map from C to machine code in a way that preserves the original program's C11 guarantees inside the machine model.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, I explore the above situation, then discuss and demonstrate ACT, a toolbox for investigating whether C11 compilers such as gcc and clang actually do this mapping correctly.
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>Communicate! Pair Programming, sketchnotes and compassion</em> by Miki Mokrysz</h4>
<b>November 21st (Autumn Week 8)</b>
<p>
<b><em>This talk will not take place this term. We apologise for the inconvenience and are trying to reschedule it</em>.</b>
</p><p>
<u>Abstract:</u> Communication can be a superpower for engineers, helping you collaborate and problem-solve without even trying. But ineffective communication undermines your work, and draining communication undermines your happiness.
</p>
<p>
This talk gives you ways to communicate technical topics without tiresome documents or formality. We'll look at the joys and perils of pair programming. We'll try out sketchnoting (drawing systems to explain them.) And we'll cover how to empathise with what other people need.
</p>
<br>
<h4><em>Where it all went wrong (or why programming sucks)</em> by Sam Hand</h4>
<b>December 5th (Autumn Week 10)</b>
<p>
<u>Abstract:</u> The word “programmer” usually refers to a person who instructs a computer through the use of some textual formal language. 
To this person computation lives inside of a text file, represented purely as a list of instructions.
</p>
<p>
Contrast this to the idea of a “user”; someone who similarly instructs a computer to do their bidding. The user, though, achieves this by dynamically interacting with a varied selection of representations of the system - be they textual, visual, or even auditory. <br>
To a user computation takes on a much more rich meaning: it can be represented in a way suitable to the task at hand. However, the power available to them is fundamentally limited. They only have access to the features the programmer of the system chose to include.
</p>
<p>
This talk will explore the reasons behind this power difference, and maybe even suggest how to fix it, without sacrificing usability.
</p>
<br>
