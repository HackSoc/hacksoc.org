title: HackSoc's IRC Channels Are Moving To libera.chat
---
We're moving!

Due to recent events at Freenode, as summarised [here][summary], 
HackSoc will be moving all its irc channels from Freenode to 
[Libera Chat][libera].

The #hacksoc channel on Libera Chat will be bridged to slack in much 
the same way as the current Freenode channel is. 

#cs-york also has a channel on Libera Chat, with the same people as 
usually hang out there. 

<del>Libera Chat does not yet have a webchat.</del> <ins>Update: this is
no longer true! You can access the webchat [at this
link][webchat].</ins> If you haven't got an irc client, then we
recommend using [The Lounge][thelounge]. This does not require any
special program. If you want an account, please contact us at
[hack@yusu.org](mailto:hack@yusu.org), or poke the infrastructure
officer.
