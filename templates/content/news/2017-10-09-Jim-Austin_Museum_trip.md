title: Get your ticket for a day full of fascinating old computers.

Note, this has been and gone, this news item is still here for reference.

HackSoc has planned a trip to Jim Austin's Computer Museum on **Saturday the 11th of November!**

It's a *huge* museum full of computers and computer hardware. It has everything from the humble microcomputers of the 80s to gigantic supercomputers from a range of industries.

If you're not already excited about it, check out the website: http://www.computermuseum.org.uk/

We have booked a coach to collect people from the *Heslington East Coach stop at 10:30am* (be there on time) to take us to the museum for a tour and a chance to look around at whatever takes your fancy (we'll return to coach stop some time after 15:00).

**Tickets will cost Â£12.** This is to partly to cover travel and partly to provide a donation to the museum. **We only have 30 places available**, so tickets will only be available to HackSoc members at first, but will be opened up to others by the end of this week.

Get yourself signed up here: (Link redacted), then contact us to arrange payment.
