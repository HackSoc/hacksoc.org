title: Spring Term Talk Submissions
---

Submissions for our Spring Term talks are now open!

Do you have a niche interest you enjoy talking about? Would you like to give a talk to a bunch of nerds, or do you need low-pressure practice in public speaking? Then why not come give a talk for us? We welcome a range of topics and would be glad to have you, and to buy you a drink after the fact.

The call is for a half hour talk, followed by fifteen minutes of questions. Talks will take place on Thursdays of every week, between 6:30 and 7:30. You don't have to have the talk written already - give us a general idea of what you'd like to talk about, and an abstract.

If you'd like to do a talk, then please sign up with [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeE1dMe0w0c4B3OYDf0V1s1tnLss6GFPBcv5vy4dy8pvoO_Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

Submissions will close on the December 9th. 

We'd love to see plenty of interesting submissions!
