title: EGM for Ordinary Member
---

Following the resignation of one of our committee's Ordinary Members, we are
holding an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to find a replacement.

The EGM will be held at 6pm on Friday 14th June in The Pod; that's an hour
before next week's Film Night.

Ordinary Members help out with miscellaneous committee tasks. It's a great way
to get started on a society committee!

To nominate yourself for this position, please send an email to
[hack@yusu.org](mailto:hack@yusu.org). You can also nominate yourself on the
night of the EGM.

It would be great to see as many of our paying members voting as possible.
If you aren't able to attend in person, please let Jacob know over Slack, and
you'll be able to vote remotely. In the event of multiple nominations, the
election will be held using the Alternative Vote (AV) system.
