title: Call for Talk Submissions
---

We're opening submissions for our talks in autumn term!

Do you have a niche interest you enjoy talking about? Would you like to give a
talk to a bunch of nerds, or do you need low-pressure practice in public
speaking? Then why not come give a talk for us? We welcome a range of topics and
would be glad to have you, and to buy you a drink after the fact.

The call is for a half hour talk, followed by fifteen minutes of questions.
Talks will take place on Thursdays of every week, between 6:30 and 7:30. You
don't have to have the talk written already - give us a general idea of what
you'd like to talk about, and an abstract.

If you'd like to do a talk, then please sign up
[with this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VOwHCRijffDxy6qvQ47_Gbn3fFod0sIPxhWxJt7e0CQ/edit?ts=5d08c2b9)!

Submissions will close on the 15th of August. We will be doing
a second call for abstracts in the autumn term.

We'd love to see plenty of interesting submissions!
