title: EGM Results
---

Before Film Night on Friday 14th June, we held an EGM to find an Ordinary 
Member following a resignation. We have 15 people voting, meeting our quorum of
15 votes. Voting was carried out using the Alternative Vote (AV) system. The
results are:

| Name               | Votes  |
|--------------------|--------|
| Sam Hart           | 15     |
| Reopen Nominations | -      |
| **Total**          | **15** |

Congratulations to our new Ordinary Member, Sam Hart! He received 100% of the
votes in the first round, so no further rounds were required.
