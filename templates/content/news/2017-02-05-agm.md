title: AGM Week 8
---

Coming up later this term is our Annual General Meeting (AGM), when we elect a brand new committee to be in charge of the society's day-to-day operations. This is your opportunity to run for a committee position, and take charge. 

A large proportion of the current committee members are graduating, so please do consider running! 

The AGM will be immediately followed by Board Games and Cake, and is on Friday the 3rd of March, at 18:45, in Room LMB/038X of the Law and Management Building. LMB/038X is none other than the moot court room, which seems to be a great place for a committee election!
