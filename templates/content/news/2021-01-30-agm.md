title: Our 2021 AGM Will Be Online
---

HackSoc will be holding its Annual General Meeting (AGM) on the
**5th of March 2021**! 

That's still a little while away, but we are announcing it earlier this year as
we'll be running it a little differently. Usually we hold our AGM on campus, but
due to the pandemic, this year **our AGM will take place online**.

There will be another announcement closer to the time describing how to apply
for a position on the committee, how to vote for candidates, and all other
details. 

Make sure you're [subscribed to the mailing list](https://forms.gle/N95yNoonXnTQmgyL7)
to stay in the loop about this year's AGM!
