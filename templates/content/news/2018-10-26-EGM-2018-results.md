title: New ordinary member - EGM results
---

We held an EGM on Friday to fill the role of Ordinary Member. We had 25 people voting, fulfilling our quorum of 17 votes. Voting was carried out using the Alternative Vote (AV) system. Here are the results:

| Name               | Votes  |
|--------------------|--------|
| Peter Harris       | 17     |
| Adam Birtles       | 7      |
| Alexander Potts    | 1      |
| Reopen Nominations | -      |
| **Total**          | **25** |

Congratulations to Peter Harris, our new Ordinary Member! He was elected with more than 50% of the votes in the first round, so there was no need to go the second round.  

The next planned elections will be held at the AGM, in the latter half of Spring term. All committee positions will be up for election.
