title: A P&P officer, at last!

We have a new Press and Publicity officer!

You may have noticed that communications from our mailing list have been a little sparse lately. Fortunately we have an enthusiatic new P&P officer, George.

He's only been in the job for a week, and allready the mailing list is looking more lively.

Welcome George, thanks for joining us.
