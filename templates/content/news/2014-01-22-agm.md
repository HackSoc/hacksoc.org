As you may know, this term we are having our AGM! We need to hold
elections, and this is your opportunity to seize power and overthrow
the old regime!

The AGM will be immediately followed by HackPub, and is on Friday the

society!**

     society where needed. In charge of the society.

     committee decisions.

We've started giving Ordinary Members responsibilities, in particular
one now maintains the servers. This is optional, but it would be
helpful if someone would assume that role.

Furthermore, constitutional amendments can be ratified at the AGM. If
you want to propose one, the deadline is NOON on Wednesday the 29th of
January.
