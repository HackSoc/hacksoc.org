title: "New servers: Latona, Apollo, and Diana"
---

After months of work and preparation, our three new servers are ready 
to use - and hosted on campus!

### History 

Over 9 months ago, we found an old HackSoc server sitting powered off
in the department, and decided to restore it and bring it back online.
It took a new motherboard, power supply, and complement of hard drives,
but we got it working!

Around the same time, our friends at [Bytemark] were getting rid of
some of their old servers, so we went down and bagged a couple. We
ended up with a 16GB and a 32GB server, each with AMD quad-core CPUs.
These took much less work to get ready to go.

As to where these servers would live, the [IT Services][ITS] agreed to
have them colocated in the University Data Center on East campus. Fast
forward to today, and all three are happily up, running, and ready for
use. 

### Our new servers
First up is [Latona]. Loaded with 4TB of drives in a RAID 6 array, it
will be a storage server for the society. Members can get a 
**50GB share** on the server included with their membership - **check
the [README][Latona] for details!**

[Apollo] and [Diana] are our ex-Bytemark servers, and while members
won't have accounts directly, they'll be used to host various services
that members can use. One of those services which we're also launching
today is [TheLounge], a web-based IRC client with some familiar
features if you've used Slack or Discord. Coupled with our IRC bouncer
on [Runciman], this is a great way to keep up with society chat on
`#hacksoc`, or check in with people over on `#cs-york`. Ask your
infrastructure officer or email [hack@yusu.org](mailto:hack@yusu.org)
for a free account.

### Names
*Latona, Apollo, Diana* are temporary names - we'd love to get your
ideas for what these servers should be called long-term! **If you want
to suggest a name, submit them on this [Google form][nameform]**
### Thanks and acknowledgements
We're really excited to finally announce these servers, and it 
couldn't have happened without the help of Bytemark, CS Hardware and 
Software Support, and IT Services.
