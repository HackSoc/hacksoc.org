title: HackSoc Sponsored by Bytemark
---

As you may know, over the Christmas break, [Bytemark][] very kindly
started sponsoring us, and have provided a [BigV][] account, on which
we have two VMs: [runciman][] and [klaxon][]. This is really awesome
of them, as we were expecting maybe a small server if we were lucky,
but they (runciman, at least) are pretty powerful!

> Bytemark Hosting is the UK's "geek hosting outfit of choice" because

> 2002, with their own tools, software and technical expertise. They
> understand web applications and network infrastructure equally, and
> host names such as Bostik, dopplr.com and Britain's largest mystery

> month and runs to multi-site managed setups for customers with the
> fussiest demands of reliability and failover.

[runciman][] is a server available for all members of the society,
currently hosting shell accounts and web hosting (paid members only),
and a Minecraft server (open to all). If you want an account, read
Bytemark's [AUP][] and get in touch with a member of the
committee.

[klaxon][] is our replacement for the /grp/ which used to live on the
old CS Linux systems. If you've never used grp, it is a
student-managed collection of software to supplement what is provided
by ITS. Anyone can access hacksoc-grp, simply by mounting it via
passwordless SSHFS, and it is "permanently" mounted on csteach0.
