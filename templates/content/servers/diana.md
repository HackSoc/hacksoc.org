## TheLounge &ndash; web-based IRC client
*Homepage: [thelounge.chat][thelounge]*  
TheLounge is an IRC client that works on desktop and mobile, for those who don't want to use WeeChat or irssi (or want a good client for Android/iOS). Its interface is familiar if you've used Slack or Discord, and has a number of neat features including image previews, emoji pickers for desktop, and push notifications for mentions.  While it does have some scrollback support, we'd recommend using ZNC on [runciman] to keep up-to-date with channels while you're away.  
You can access TheLounge at [thelounge.hacksoc.org](https://thelounge.hacksoc.org). Message your [infrastructure officer][about] for an account.
