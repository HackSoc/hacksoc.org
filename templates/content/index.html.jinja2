    <h2>Board Games and Cake</h2>
    <p>In one of the oldest and noblest traditions of HackSoc, we descend upon a room, play many boardgames, and eat much cake. Both boardgames and cake are brought along by members, so if you do enjoy the events, please consider bringing something along.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="infobox">
    <h2>Virtual Games and Cake</h2>
    <p>Join us in adapting our age-old Boardgames and Cake to a virtual setting in our Discord server, where we check in with each other and play games including Jackbox and Uno! Unfortunately, we can't bring and share cake, but we can make our own and post them on Discord.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="infobox">
    <h2>CoffeeScript</h2>
    <p>An unprecedented case of joviality and camaraderie has struck HackSoc, and we have responded with a weekly social over in the Ron Cooke Hub cafe on Hes East. Come for lunch, a chat, and maybe a small game or two.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="infobox">
    <h2>Talks</h2>
    <p>In which we sit in a room en masse (or watch a YouTube Premiere) to hear the ramblings of someone who knows way too much about a very niche topic speaking about said topic. We then have a Q&amp;A session. We aim for a healthy balance of members, alumni and industry speakers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="infobox">
    <h2>HackPub</h2>
    <p>Another tradition with a long and glorious history, the humble HackPub, in which we visit the Rook and Gaskill near Walmgate and converse late into the night with members past and present about high culture, politics, and how old jet engines work over a pint (of something non-alcoholic, if you so desire).</p>
