    <h2>Board Games and Cake</h2>
    <p>In one of the oldest and noblest traditions of HackSoc, we descend upon a room, play many boardgames, and eat much cake. Both boardgames and cake are brought along by members, so if you do enjoy the events, please consider bringing something along.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="infobox">
    <h2>Virtual Games and Cake</h2>
    <p>Join us in adapting our age-old Boardgames and Cake to a virtual setting in our Discord server, where we check in with each other and play games including Jackbox and Uno! Unfortunately, we can't bring and share cake, but we can make our own and post them on Discord.</p>

    <h2>PicnicScript</h2>
    <p>A weekly lunchtime event (weather and COVID-19 permitting) where we all meet and consume food near the CSE building. Feel free to grab yourself a lunch from Greggs, RCH, or Nisa, and come say hi!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="infobox">
    <h2>Talks</h2>
    <p>In which we sit in a room en masse (or watch a YouTube Premiere) to hear the ramblings of someone who knows way too much about a very niche topic speaking about said topic. We then have a Q&amp;A session. We aim for a healthy balance of members, alumni and industry speakers.</p>

    <div class="infobox">
    <h2>PlayTogether</h2>
    <p>We gather in Discord and play a narrative video game together, voting on the story choices to make!</p>
