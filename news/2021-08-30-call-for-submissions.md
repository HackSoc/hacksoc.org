title: Autumn Term Talk Submissions
---

Submissions for our Autumn Term talks are now open!

Do you have a niche interest you enjoy talking about? Then why not come give a
talk for us; we welcome a range of topics and would be glad to have you!

The call is for a half hour talk, followed by fifteen minutes of questions.
Talks will take place on Thursdays of every week, between 7:00pm and 8:00pm.
You don't have to have the talk written already - give us a general idea of what
you'd like to talk about, and an abstract.

For the first time since the pandemic began, this term we will be running a
mixture of in-person and online talks! We will allocate a split between talks
running on campus in-person, and talks which are pre-recorded and live-streamed
using YouTube Premiere. Talks in both formats will be followed by an interactive
Q&A! (See the form linked below for more information.)

If you'd like to do a talk, then please sign up with
[this Google Form](https://forms.gle/C2hnR8efhQ8iXCvJ6)!

Submissions will close on the 20th of September. 

We'd love to see plenty of interesting submissions!
