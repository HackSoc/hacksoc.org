The committee is dead, long live the committee!

Your new overlords are as follows,

 - Michael Walker remained Chair

 - Nathan van Doorn remained Treasurer
 - Declan Ibberson became Crockery Officer

 - Oliver (Ollie) Downard became Diplomat

And the ordinary members:

 - Charles Pigott (remained)
 - Shivam Mistry (former Society Crier)

Didn't manage to get rid of me this year, although I am told I only
won on a technicality, so better luck next time!
