Same bat-committee, same bat-society.

The Diplomat ammendment passed,

> that can help provide opportunities and resources to further our
> members and the society.

 - Michael Walker remained Chair.
 - David Morris remained Secretary.
 - Nathan van Doorn became Treasurer.
 - Lauren Tomasello remained Crockery Officer.
 - Shivam Mistry remained Society Crier.
 - Michael Mokrysz became Diplomat.
 - Charles Pigott and Dr. Ian Benest remained Ordinary Members.
