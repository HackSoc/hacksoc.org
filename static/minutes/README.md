# Minutes

See [Adding meeting minutes](../../docs/minutes.md).

Minutes should be named `YYYY-MM-DD_Minute_n.pdf` and go in the folder corresponding to the **committee term** (not academic year). For example, a committee elected in 2021 would exist until the next AGM in 2022; the minutes taken by this committee go in the `2021-22` folder.
